Django testing
============

I'm very new to django testing therefore I wish to use many ways for testing.

I will try testing (for now) with Travis CI and QUnit / perhaps tox.

Using Travis CI:
    - Create a file called .travis.yml

QUnit Install:
    - pip install QUnitSuite 

Most of my commits will be tests. 

Just a heads up...
