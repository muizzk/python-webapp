Django testing
============

I'm very new to django testing therefore I wish to use many ways for testing.
This isn't advisable in any way, but like I said I wish to learn the ways to test django.

I will try testing (for now) with Travis CI and tox  / perhaps QUnit.

Using Travis CI:
    - Create a file called .travis.yml
    - Add Travis CI to settings.py 

Tox install:
    - pip install tox
    - create files tox.ini and pyproject.toml
    
QUnit Install:
    - pip install QUnitSuite 

Most of my commits will be tests. 

Just a heads up...
